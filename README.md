# ERD-Application

Welcome to ViSo-Nice ERD.

Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) Data Modeling Software. Current Version supports Microsoft SQL and C# Code. More may follow in due time.

The 'ERD Msi' folder contains an installable (ViSo.Viewer.msi) and a short description of function documentation (ViSo.docx)

This Application was developed and is maintained to provide a useful manner in managing database entities, view the data thereof and script recursive code.

It allows for multiple database connections, locking of files by developers, scripting of SQL for distribution, and generating code (Supports C# types) for standard queries. Support for virtual relations makes this application ideal for development where actual database relations are a constraint that cannot be implemented but would be nice to view

The Sample project supplied provides a posable way of ding things. Just change the SQL Connection information in the 'ViSo Nice.eprj' file to a valid database and select the file from the application.
